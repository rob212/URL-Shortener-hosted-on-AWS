# Learning Goals

This project is designed to teach practical AWS skills through hands-on experience.

---

## Primary learning goals

By completing, learners should be able to:

- Explain what problem each AWS service is solving
- Describe how AWS services communicate with each other
- Deploy and test simple serverless architectures
- Understand basic AWS security boundaries (public vs private)
- Navigate the AWS Management Console with confidence

---

## AWS services you will learn

Across iterations, learners will work with:

- Amazon S3 (static website hosting)
- Cloudfront
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon API Gateway
- Amazon DynamoDB
- AWS IAM
- Amazon CloudWatch

Later iterations may introduce:

- Custom domains
- Infrastructure as Code
- Authentication and rate limiting

---

## Engineering skills you will practice

In addition to AWS knowledge, this project helps develop:

- Reading and drawing architecture diagrams
- Reasoning about trade-offs
- Debugging distributed systems
- Writing clear technical documentation
- Thinking in terms of access patterns and data flow

---

## What success looks like

A learner has succeeded if they can:

- Build the system from scratch without copying blindly
- Explain the architecture to another engineer
- Identify limitations in the current design
- Suggest reasonable improvements for future iterations
- Understand _why_ certain AWS services were chosen

---

## Mindset expectations

- This is a learning exercise, not a production system
- Curiosity is more important than speed
- Breaking things is encouraged
- Questions are expected and welcomed

Understanding comes from experimentation, not memorisation.
